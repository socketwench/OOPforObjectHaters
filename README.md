A reveal.js presentation explaining the basic concepts of PHP Object Oriented Programming.

## Summary

Drupal 8 is here, and with it a completely new world of Object Oriented Programming (OOP). While PHP had classes before, PHP 5 has evolved into a modern OOP language with structures and features that have been in other languages for a decade.

If you've never used classes, namespaces, or exceptions before, it's like learning a whole new programming language. In this session, we break down the core concepts of OOP, see some example code, and take a peek at how these are used in Drupal 8.
